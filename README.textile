h2. Rating Stars

p. Rating stars is a javascript library to easily allow you to having a rating widget (or many rating widgets) on a page, and submit that rating back to a server via Ajax.

h3. Prerequisites

* prototype.js
* lowpro.js (mainly for the '$' methods it provides, but it would be a great way to unobtrusively instantiate the widget)

h3. Installation

p. There is one javascript file (rating_stars.js) and two images that comprise the widget. Just put the .js file and the image files in a place publicly accessible in your application.

h3. Usage

p. In the simplest case, all you need is a div to place the widget and a url to submit the rating to.

<pre>
  <div id="widget"></div>
  
  <script type="text/javascript">
    new RatingStars.Widget({
      'holder': 'widget',
      'url': '/url/for/submission'
    });
  </script>
</pre>

p. There are other options that can be passed in to customize the widget:

* *initialMessage*: The message that first appears when the widget is instantiated. Defaults to 'Click to submit'.
* *submittedMessage*: The message that appears when the widget is submitted. This assumes that when you submit that no text comes back from the Ajax response. Defaults to 'Thanks for voting!'.
* *readOnly*: Specifies whether the widget can be submitted or not. Useful in tandem with the 'rating' option. Defaults to false.
* *rating*: The initial rating shown on the widget. Defaults to 0. Possible values: 0 - 100.
